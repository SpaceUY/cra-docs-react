### Choosing the Right Date Handling Library for Your React Project

There are several libraries available for data handling, but we recommend Date-fns.

**Date-fns**: A modern library that provides a wide range of pure functions for manipulating JavaScript dates. It's lighter than Moment.js and offers an immutable API, which can help prevent bugs.

### Pros & Cons

### Date-fns

**Pros**:

- **Lightweight**: Significantly smaller than Moment.js since you import only the functions you need.
- **Immutable**: The functions don't change the objects they're given, which aids in the predictability of your code.

**Cons**

- **Syntax**: Some developers do not prefer its syntax compared to chain-able syntax provided by libraries like Moment.js or Day.js.
